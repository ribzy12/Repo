MusicSearch is a program that I wrote will in college for my Object Oriented Design & Analysis class.  We have a hypothetical store called Music Plex.  This program is meant to act similar to the helper computers in Borders stores.  When the program starts up you can search for an album by the artist, album or complete or partial song title.  The main class is Display.java.  For this project I was in a group of three and was the main programmer I coded everything expect for some of the I/O code.  The data the program uses is stored in two text files (Artist.txt and Album1.txt) which are loaded when the program starts.
